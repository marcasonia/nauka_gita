## Welcome to today's **class** or should I say *torture* :smiling_imp:

This will be a new adventure in to the world of GIT


**Change 1**: Using two '**' before and after a word makes the word bold

Ex: **GIT**

**Change 2**: Using one '*' before and after a word makes the word italic

Ex: *GIT*


**Change 3**: Haven't learned anything else yet for GIT/Markdown

Still a long way to go :smile:


GIT is a useful tool

Or so I am told...

We will see, we will see

Ok, so I am to change something here.
I do not have any idea what to change...too bad.
